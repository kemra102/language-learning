## Nouns

Nouns are the names of things such as:

- country
- plant
- person
- planet

### Proper Nouns

As opposed to so called "Common" [nouns](#nouns), Proper Nouns are the specific names of things such as:

- Germany
- Daisy
- John
- Jupiter

>NOTE: There are many "sub-types" of Nouns but they are generally not important outside of people studing linguistics.

## Pronouns

Pronouns are a tricky subject, but can broadly be thought of as words that replace [Nouns](#nouns) such as:

- I
- You
- She
- They

## Verbs

Verbs are words that convey an action, an occurrence or a state of being such as:

- read
- walk
- happen
- become
- exist
- is

## Adjectives

An Adjective sometimes referred to as a "describing" word is used to modify a [noun](#nouns) or [proper noun](#proper-nouns). This is often in the form of describing *how much*, *which one* or *what kind* for example. Some examples are:

- Germany is a **large** country.
- A Daisey has **white** petals.
- John has 2 **young** children.
- Jupiter is the **largest** planet in the Solar System.

Although the above examples show the Adjective appearing directly before the Noun, this is not always the case.

> In many languages adjectives must occur in a specific order when multiple are used. If not they they will sound incredibly jarring to a native speaker. For more information on this in English see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective#Order).

## Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives or indeed other adverbs by expressing things such as *manner*, *place*, *time*, *frequency*, *degree* or *level of certainty*. Some examples are:

- She sang **loudly** (loudly modifies the verb sang, indicating the manner of singing)
- We left it **here** (here modifies the verb phrase left it, indicating place)
- I worked **yesterday** (yesterday modifies the verb worked, indicating time)
- You **often** make mistakes (often modifies the verb phrase make mistakes, indicating frequency)
- He **undoubtedly** did it (undoubtedly modifies the verb phrase did it, indicating certainty)

## Prepositions

Prepositions express relationships between nouns, particularly spatial or temporal relationships. Some examples are:

- As an adjunct to a noun:
    - the weather **in** March
    - cheese **from** France **with** live bacteria
- As a predicative expression
    - The key is **under** the stone.
- As an adjunct to a verb:
    - sleep **throughout** the winter
    - danced **atop** the tables **for** hours
    - dispense **with** the formalities
- As an adjunct to an adjective:
    - happy **for** them
    - sick **until** recently

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions are used to connect words phrases or clauses. Some examples are:

- **For** – presents rationale ("They do not gamble or smoke, for they are ascetics.")
- **And** – presents non-contrasting item(s) or idea(s) ("They gamble, and they smoke.")
- **Nor** – presents a non-contrasting negative idea ("They do not gamble, nor do they smoke.")
- **But** – presents a contrast or exception ("They gamble, but they don't smoke.")
- **Or** – presents an alternative item or idea ("Every day they gamble, or they smoke.")
- **Yet** – presents a contrast or exception ("They gamble, yet they don't smoke.")
- **So** – presents a consequence ("He gambled well last night, so he smoked a cigar to celebrate.")

## Articles

In English there is the definite article `the`, and the indefinite articles `a` & `an`. Use of the definite article implies that the speaker assumes the listener knows the identity of the noun's [referent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referent) (because it is obvious, because it is common knowledge, or because it was mentioned in the same sentence or an earlier sentence). Use of an indefinite article implies that the speaker assumes the listener does not have to be told the identity of the referent.
