This is my personal "Wiki" to aid me in learning other (natural) languages. I do have problems learning languages as my understanding of the fundamentals of what makes up a language is rather poor. As such there will be a large section covering the very basics, the basics that many people actually remember from school.

Although this is for my personal use I welcome others to use it should they find it useful.
